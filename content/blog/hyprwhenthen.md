Ever had a window that should float but doesn't? Think of those `OAuth popups`
that start as `Mozilla Firefox` then change into `Sign in – Google Accounts`.

Hyprland's
[static window rules](https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Window-Rules/#static-rules)
(like `float`) only trigger **when a window is created** — not when its title
changes later. What if we could catch those title changes and react instantly?

Enter [**hyprwhenthen**](https://github.com/fiffeek/hyprwhenthen): a tiny Go
tool that listens to Hyprland events and runs your scripts when regex patterns
match.

## Quick Reference: Common Hyprland Event Commands

### Toggle floating window

```bash
hyprctl dispatch togglefloating address:0x12345678
```

### Center a floating window

```bash
hyprctl dispatch centerwindow address:0x12345678
```

### Center and resize a floating window

```bash
# Toggle floating
hyprctl dispatch togglefloating address:0x12345678
# Resize to 50% screen size
hyprctl dispatch resizewindowpixel exact 50% 50%,address:0x12345678
# Center it
hyprctl dispatch centerwindow address:0x12345678
```

**Want these to happen automatically based on Hyprland events?** Read on to see
how hyprwhenthen makes window title changes, focus events, and workspace
switches trigger these commands automatically.

## Quick install

```bash
$aurHelper -S hyprwhenthen-bin
```

or grab a prebuilt binary from the
[releases page](https://github.com/fiffeek/hyprwhenthen/releases).

## Example solution

Here’s a `~/.config/hyprwhenthen/config.toml` that reacts whenever a window’s
title matches `Sign in – Google Accounts`:

```ini {% title="~/.config/hyprwhenthen/config.toml" %}
[[handler]]
on = "windowtitlev2"
# (.*) captures the window's address (first field), then we match the title
when = "(.*),Sign In - Google Accounts — Mozilla Firefox"
then = "~/.config/hyprwhenthen/scripts/float.sh $REGEX_GROUP_1"
```

And here’s a minimal `float.sh`:

```bash {% title="~/.config/hyprwhenthen/scripts/float.sh" %}
#!/bin/bash
ADDRESS="0x$1"

# Toggle floating, resize to 50% x 50% of screen, and center it
hyprctl dispatch togglefloating "address:$ADDRESS" || \
  exit 0  # exit silently if window no longer exists

hyprctl dispatch resizewindowpixel exact 50% 50%,"address:$ADDRESS"
hyprctl dispatch centerwindow "address:$ADDRESS"
```

Now every OAuth popup **automatically becomes a centered floating window** — no
more manual dragging and resizing.

## Why not existing tools?

- [shellevents](https://github.com/hyprwm/contrib/tree/main/shellevents) /
  [hyprevents](https://github.com/vilari-mickopf/hyprevents) → simple bash
  wrappers, but limited pattern matching
- [pyprland](https://github.com/hyprland-community/pyprland) → powerful, but
  overkill for quick one-off event reactions
- raw `socat` → works, but gets messy with complex logic (e.g. background
  processing, event ordering)

[**hyprwhenthen**](https://github.com/fiffeek/hyprwhenthen) hits the sweet spot:

- ✅ Regex-based matching: match event context and capture matching groups
- ✅ Parallel execution: run handlers in the background
- ✅ Hot reloading: configuration change triggers automatic service reload
- ✅ Event ordering: events for the same window can be processed serially

Perfect for those _"I wish Hyprland could just..."_ moments.

## FAQ: Hyprland Events and Window Management

### What are Hyprland events?

Hyprland events are real-time notifications emitted by the compositor whenever
something happens - like a window opening, title changing, workspace switching,
or monitor connecting. You can listen to these events using
`socat UNIX-CONNECT:/tmp/hypr/$HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE/.socket2.sock -` or
use tools like hyprwhenthen to react to them automatically.

Common Hyprland events include:

- `windowtitlev2` - Window title changes
- `openwindow` - New window created
- `closewindow` - Window closed
- `activewindow` - Window focused
- `workspace` - Workspace switched
- `monitoradded` / `monitorremoved` - Monitor changes

### How do I use hyprctl dispatch togglefloating?

The `togglefloating` dispatcher switches a window between floating and tiled
mode:

```bash
# Toggle current window
hyprctl dispatch togglefloating

# Toggle specific window by address
hyprctl dispatch togglefloating address:0x12345678

# Toggle by window class
hyprctl dispatch togglefloating class:firefox
```

You can bind this to a key in your Hyprland config:

```bash
bind = SUPER, V, togglefloating,
```

Or use hyprwhenthen to automatically float windows based on title changes.

### How do I center a floating window in Hyprland?

Use the `centerwindow` dispatcher:

```bash
# Center current window
hyprctl dispatch centerwindow

# Center specific window
hyprctl dispatch centerwindow address:0x12345678
```

For automatic centering when windows float, combine with hyprwhenthen:

```ini
[[handler]]
on = "windowtitlev2"
when = "(.*),Sign In - Google Accounts"
then = "~/.config/hyprwhenthen/scripts/float-and-center.sh $REGEX_GROUP_1"
```

### How can I automatically float and center OAuth popups?

Use hyprwhenthen to detect title changes and run commands. Here's a complete
example:

**Config** (`~/.config/hyprwhenthen/config.toml`):

```ini
[[handler]]
on = "windowtitlev2"
when = "(.*),Sign In - Google Accounts"
then = "~/.config/hyprwhenthen/scripts/float-center.sh $REGEX_GROUP_1"
```

**Script** (`~/.config/hyprwhenthen/scripts/float-center.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
ADDRESS="0x$1"
hyprctl dispatch togglefloating "address:$ADDRESS"
hyprctl dispatch resizewindowpixel exact 50% 50%,"address:$ADDRESS"
hyprctl dispatch centerwindow "address:$ADDRESS"
```

This automatically floats, resizes, and centers any window matching the title
pattern.

### What's the difference between static window rules and event-based automation?

**Static window rules** in Hyprland apply only when a window is created:

```bash
windowrule = float, ^(pavucontrol)$
```

This works if the window class/title is known at creation time.

**Event-based automation** (like hyprwhenthen) reacts to changes during a
window's lifetime:

- Window title changes (OAuth popups)
- Window class updates
- Focus changes
- Any other Hyprland event

Use static rules for predictable windows, event automation for dynamic ones.

### How do I list all Hyprland events?

Connect to Hyprland's event socket:

```bash
socat UNIX-CONNECT:/tmp/hypr/$HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE/.socket2.sock -
```

Then interact with Hyprland (open windows, switch workspaces, etc.) to see
events in real-time.

For a full list of event types, see the
[Hyprland IPC documentation](https://wiki.hypr.land/IPC/).

### Can I use hyprwhenthen for workspace automation?

Yes! You can react to `workspace` events to automate layout changes:

```ini
[[handler]]
on = "workspace"
when = "workspace>>3"  # When switching to workspace 3
then = "hyprctl keyword monitor DP-1,3840x2160@144,0x0,1.5"
```

Or move specific apps to dedicated workspaces when they open:

```ini
[[handler]]
on = "openwindow"
when = ">>.*Spotify.*"
then = "hyprctl dispatch movetoworkspacesilent 9"
```
